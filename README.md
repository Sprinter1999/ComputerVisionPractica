 .Based on https://github.com/lightaime 
 But this is 2018-version-assignment.
 So some patches according to needs are added.
 Assignment2 is done but there's no tensorflow part(which accounts for 10% of the whole ass2).
 Taking some school course requirements into account,no more updates on this repo in the following days.
 You can refer to Lightaime's repo of Assignment3.
