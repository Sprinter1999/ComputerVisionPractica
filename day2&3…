sth wrong with my pc…
damn it！

I just reinstall and modify some tools and settings...

The most fu*king thing is to reinstall Anaconda3....
Since the distribution version varies a lot in the Anaconda official net,it's hard to 
confirm whether this distribution version suits ur pc best,and in most cases u need to try...
Some issues r hard to solve but for my Lenovo Thinkpad PC，I choose 5.2.0（x86-64）....

And then I use my script to reinstall some python packages and create an environment to
carry out my computer vision homework locally.

Next I continued to learn about classification methods and I just catched up with Loss Func ,finished the KNN script certainly
(which is my first CV output）

Anyway，when ass1 is finished，I'll upload to this Repo,I think that day is tomorrow(2.20).
